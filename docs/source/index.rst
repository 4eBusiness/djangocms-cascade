Welcome to djangocms-bootstrap's documentation!
===============================================

**DjangoCMS-Bootstrap** is a collection of CMS plugins, which can be used to manipulate the
structure inside any of the DjangoCMS_ ``{% placeholder %}`` fields.

When editing a DjangoCMS page in structure mode, one can add plugins_ to a CMS placeholder_. Since
DjangoCMS version 3.0, these plugins can be nested giving the possibility to create plugins inside
other plugins.

`Twitter Bootstrap`_ is a well documented CSS framework which gives web designers lots of
possibilities to add a consistent structure to their pages. This collection of DjangoCMS plugins
offers some of these predefined HTML elements to web designers.

With this collection, a web designer with some basic understanding of the DOM_ and the Bootstrap
`grid system`_, can create structured web pages without having to fiddle with HTML templates.
